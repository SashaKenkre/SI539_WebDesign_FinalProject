			<h1>My puppy, Bodie!</h1>
			<p>My family's puppy, Bodie, is the newest addition to our family. We brought him home in December 2020 and it's been a wild ride since. 
				We've never had a dog before, so we were in for a big change when we got him. While he's a lot of work, you can't help but love him and his adorableness.
			Some of the nicknames I've already bestowed upon him are: Boopers, Boops, and Bodie Bear! </p>
